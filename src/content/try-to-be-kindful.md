In a world where negativity and stress are all too common, it's easy to forget the importance of kindness and compassion. But what if we made a conscious effort to be more kindful every day? What if we approached every interaction with empathy and understanding, and made an effort to spread positivity wherever we go? Being kindful isn't just about doing good deeds, it's a mindset that can change the way we see the world and interact with others.

I have a problem saying nice things when facing people, not because I don't want to do it, it's just I don't know how to do it, I try to speak normally like everyone else, but when the conversation ends, I feel I said something wrong, such as messy rhetoric, too high intonation and more ðŸ˜¥.

I am an introvert, of course to talk well with people is difficult for me, because I rarely talk to other people, even to leave the house I rarely do it unless there is a need to go.

The two problems above are obstacles to being kind, because I am busy thinking about mistakes rather than planning what good deeds I can do for other people, I rarely meet and have conversations with people, so I often make mistakes when interacting with people.

So, to improve myself and being a kindful person, I do a few things which I wish I could have a good conversation when I facing people :

1. Go out   
    I am a Muslim, of course we Muslims are ordered to pray 5 time a day, especially for men, doing pray on the mosque is highly recomended based on the opinion of most scholar.

    I went to the mosque on foot, so I can face a lot of people and I can interact with them, or least to greet them.

2. Stop to talking bad to myself  
   As I said before, every time the conversation ends, I always feel that there is something wrong with what I said before.
   
   To overcome this, every conversation ends, rather than busy checking for something wrong in my words, I prefer not to think about it, and plan something that I will do.

3. Give good words and intonation   
   Words are important when having a conversation, and so is intonation, give good words and intonation to whoever you are dealing with, even though in previous conversations with the same person you had a bad experience, but always position yourself that you have never had experience bad or even like the first time you meet the person.
   
   The above will make us comfortable when dealing with people, and allow us to think clearly about what to talk about when the conversation stops.

4. Always do good  
    Everyone has the right to get your kindness, including people who have done bad things to you before, one good deed will trigger us to do other good deeds.

    Being kind and doing good things not only benefits others, but it also has a positive impact on our own lives. When we show kindness, we create positive connections and foster a sense of community. By helping others, we gain a sense of purpose and fulfillment, and this can lead to increased happiness and improved mental health. Additionally, when we do good things, we inspire others to do the same, creating a ripple effect of positivity. So, by being kindful and doing good things, we not only make a difference in the lives of others, but we also create a better world for ourselves and those around us.

In conclusion, being kindful is a powerful practice that can have a positive impact on ourselves and those around us. It can make us feel better, improve our relationships, and even make the world a better place. Through simple acts of kindness, we can spread love and positivity, creating a ripple effect that can inspire others to do the same. So let's embrace kindness as a way of life and make a commitment to practicing it every day.

As we conclude, let us remember that small acts of kindness can make a big difference. It only takes a moment to smile, lend a listening ear, or offer a helping hand. By doing so, we can create a brighter and more compassionate world. So let's go out and be kindful, one act of kindness at a time.

Personally I try to be kind and have good morals, because this can increase your faith in god, and increased faith will make you enthusiastic about doing good, I don't care whether people will repay my kindness, because the best reward is from God side.
