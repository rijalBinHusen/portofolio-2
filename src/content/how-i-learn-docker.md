I'm having trouble to develop app with different php version, I think it's time to start development using docker, so the application is isolated from my operating system and i don't need to install too many php version in my machine

This is the way I setup a docker container inside my ubuntu machine

## Setting Up Dockerfile

Although both our MySQL and Nginx services will be based on default images obtained from the Docker Hub, we still need to build a custom image for the application container. Weâ€™ll create a new Dockerfile for that.
