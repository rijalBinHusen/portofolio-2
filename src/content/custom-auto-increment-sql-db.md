In this blog post, we will discuss how to implement auto increment with custom value in MySQL. Auto increment is a feature of MySQL that allows you to automatically generate unique values for your database rows. This can be useful for keeping track of records in your database, as you don't have to worry about manually assigning values.

However, sometimes you may want to use a custom value for your auto increment column. This could be for a number of reasons, such as if you want to use a sequential number for your records, or if you want to use a unique identifier that is generated by your application.

In this blog post, we will show you how to implement auto increment with custom value in MySQL. We will also discuss the benefits of using custom values for your auto increment column.

Here are some of the benefits of using custom values for your auto increment column:

- Uniqueness: Custom values are guaranteed to be unique, which can be helpful for keeping track of records in your database.
  - Efficiency: Using custom values can help to improve the efficiency of your database queries.
  - Flexibility: Custom values give you more flexibility in how you manage your database records.
